Methods
1) Data Collection: yfinance is used to download historical stock price data.
2) Calculate Returns: The daily percentage change in adjusted closing prices is calculated to understand the daily return of each stock.
3) Mean-Variance Optimization: This is a quantitative tool that creates an 'efficient frontier' from which the optimal portfolio can be selected. It considers both the return and the volatility of the portfolio, seeking to maximize return for a given level of risk or to minimize risk for a given level of return.
4) Decision Trees and Neural Networks (orother models)  are then used to predict future stock returns or directions.
